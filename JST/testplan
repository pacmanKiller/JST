^these are all absolute blocks(e.i. first 30 correct, second 30 wrong, 
last ones unchanged)
^First and end are always counted in absolute blocks ;)

All of the ones with "variable middles" can be tested with the middle 
types rotated around.
| Cor  | Cor/Wro | Cor | <--reports only the wrong ones in middle
| Cor  | Cor/Unc | Cor | <--reports unchanged or nothing special? No 
reporting probably
